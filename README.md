In this project, which I prepared based on Chaoo Charles's Full-Stack E-Commerce Project with React (Next.js) course, I used typescript and tailwind CSS.

I used prisma for database operations, stripe for payment processing, axios for http requests, bcrypt to securely store passwords, next-auth to provide authentication and session management, react-hook-form for form management, react-hot-toast for notifications.
